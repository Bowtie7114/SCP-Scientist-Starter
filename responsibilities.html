            <h2>Meetings</h2>
            <p>As with any office based role, or any role that requires a modicrum of thought/bureaucracy, you will have to attend regular meetings. <br>
                Most of them will be held in room 231 on floor B4. All of your meetings can be found in your online calendar but some of the reoccuring ones are:<br>
                - Every Monday 10:30 meeting with your direct supervisor to detect any possible roadblocks for the week ahead as well as establish a list of priority tasks. <br>
                - Every second Wednesday of the month at 13:00 meeting with the Site Director to raise awarness about new safty protocols and any improvements to be implemented. <br>
                - Every 5th of the month free pizza event at the cafet<span id="wrong-letter" onclick="correctLetter()">o</span>ria. Good for networking. Not mandatory, but we recommend it. 12:00 to 13:00.<br>
