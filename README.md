### Version Control ###

This website was made using Gitpod as the IDE which was linked to GitHub, allowing it to be saved as a remote repository named "SCP-Scientist-Starter" using git commands.

Said commands used to push to the repository are:

```git add <file>``` which adds the file (or all changes if you use . ) to the staging area to be committed.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` then commits the changes that were added previously, along with a message indicating what was changed. These commits are then queued together before being pushed.

```git push``` will then update the repository with all of the previously committed code, including their messages and timestamps, to the GitHub repository linked to the IDE.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages ###
The site was deployed using Github Pages. The live link to the site is: TBA
