            <h2>SCP-914</h2>
            <h3>Object Class: Safe </h3>
            <p><em>SCP-914, The Clockworks, is a large clockwork device weighing several tons and covering an area of eighteen square meters, consisting of screw drives, belts, pulleys, gears, springs and other clockwork.<br>
                The words Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine are positioned at points around the knob. Below the knob is a large “key” that winds the “mainspring”.<br><br>

                When an object is placed in the Intake Booth, a door slides shut, and a small bell sounds. If the knob is turned to any position and the key wound up, SCP-914 will “refine” the object in the booth.<br> 
                No energy is lost in the process, and the object appears to be in stasis until the Output Booth door is opened.</em><br><br>
            
                As a safe class anomaly, SCP-914 will be one of your easier assignments: monitoring. Tests are conducted constantly so all we need is someone to ensure nothing changes.<br>
                You will check it thoroughly every week for anything new, and only this.</p>

            <h2>SCP-999</h2>
            <h3>Object Class: Safe</h3>
            <p><em>
                SCP-999 appears to be a large, amorphous, gelatinous mass of translucent orange slime, weighing about 54 kg (120 lbs) with a consistency similar to that of peanut butter.<br>
                Subjects temperament is best described as playful and dog-like: when approached, SCP-999 will often react with overwhelming elation, slithering over to the nearest person and leaping upon them,<br>
                “hugging” them with a pair of pseudopods while nuzzling the persons face with a third pseudopod, all the while emitting high-pitched gurgling and cooing noises.<br>
                Simply touching SCP-999s surface causes an immediate mild euphoria, which intensifies the longer one is exposed to SCP-999, and lasts long after separation from the creature.<br><br></em>
            
                As with everyone else at the Site, your role will be to play with SCP-999 when it appears bored, and you will be part of its food rotation duties.<br>
                SCP-999 is the kindest being you will ever come across - be sure to show it the same kindness.</p>

            <h2>SCP-847</h2>
            <h3>Object Class: Euclid</h3>
            <p><em>SCP-847 is a human female mannequin, 156 cm tall and 27 kg in mass, constructed of human hair and an unknown composite fibrous polymer that abrades and shatters similarly to porcelain.<br>
                   SCP-847 is animate and moves with erratic, stiff motions while shuddering to maintain balance. It demonstrates different behaviors depending on the genotypical sex and identified gender of nearby humans.</em><br><br>
                
                   It is strongly advised that you read the full file on this SCP. Tests will involve discovering a means to change SCP-847s demeanor, or perhaps calmly and painlessly deactivating it by relieving its mental state.<br>
                   However, please note that if you are do not have an XY chromosome set, and identify as female, you will be in severe danger within 50 meteres of SCP-847. Maintain caution at all times.</p>

            <h2>SCP-106</h2>
            <h3>Object Class: Keter</h3>
            <p><em>SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. <br>
               This appearance may vary, but the “rotting” quality is observed in all forms. <br>
               106 causes a “corrosion” effect in all solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds after contact. <br>
               This is observed as rusting, rotting, and cracking of materials, and the creation of a black, mucus-like substance</em><br><br>
            
               SCP-106 is a severe threat and must be managed carefully. As a Keter-Class anomaly with the ability to end your life
               faster than you can blink, it is advised you read through the containment procedures carefully. Your main task regarding SCP-106 is
               conceiving of a method of terminating the entity with as little collateral damage to SCP-staff and infrastructure as possible.
