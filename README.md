# SCP Scientist Orientation #
The SCP Scientist Orientation is an interactive website in which the user takes a mostly-guided tour through an orientation process for a new Level 2 Scientist working at the fictional SCP Foundation. <br>
The purposefully sterile look of the site should belay the overall feel of the Foundation compared to what they do, with descriptions and images of protocols and SCPs, and links in the footnotes to the main source of information for them.<br><br>

The site's intended audience is those who are familiar with the SCP Foundation and enjoy perusing the non-canon content on offer, as well as those not massively familiar with the Foundation, <br>
as a way to stoke curiosity, with many links, images, and references to the main site to allow them to explore further. The live site can be accessed here: [SCP Scientist Orientation](https://bowtie7114.github.io/SCP-Scientist-Starter/index.html).<br><br>

## Testing (May be in separate .md file depending on size) ##
### Accessibility ###

### Lighthouse ###

### Functional ###

### Validators ###
- HTML
The [W3C HTML Validator]() was used for each separate html page and showed the following:

- index.html passed on the first test after development:<br>
![index Validator](docs/readme_images/index_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- welcome.html did not pass due to a trailing slash on an input and an error that an 'a' element must not be a descendant of a button element.<br>
The code for this was ``` ``` <br>
It has been changed to ```<input type="button" id="next-page-button" onclick="location.href='scps.html';" value="Next page">```<br>.
Upon changing the above, no further errors were identified:<br>
![welcome validator](docs/readme_images/welcome_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- scps.html did not pass due to a p element being the child of a ul element. This was changed to an li and the issue resolved.

- CSS
The [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator showed zero errors upon testing at the end of development.<br><br>

![CSS Validator](docs/readme_images/CSS_validator.PNG)<br><br>

### Bugs and Fixes ###
- A separate scriptsheet was created specifically for the index page, index.js, to house the animation javascript code. It would run on other pages continuously as it was looking for elements that did not exist on those pages due to the eventhandler 
allocated to it. Future attempts will work towards making it so that the separate page was not necessary.
- Following on from the above - code was added on lines 1-5 of script.js that allows the page target from the URL to be shortened to just the html names (eg. index.html, welcome.html etc). I could then use if statements so that certain functions only worked on certain pages, preventing continuous loading where it was not needed.

- When opening the python3 server the day after creating the fade animation, it ceased to work. This was because the if statement was checking for index.html, which did not appear on the end of the page URL when first loading, it appeared as an empty string. By adding the empty string as an or ( || ) to the if statement, it began to function as normal.

## Deployment ##
### Version Control ###

This website was made using Gitpod as the IDE which was linked to GitHub, allowing it to be saved as a remote repository named "SCP-Scientist-Starter" using git commands.

Said commands used to push to the repository are:

```git add <file>``` which adds the file (or all changes if you use . ) to the staging area to be committed.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` then commits the changes that were added previously, along with a message indicating what was changed. These commits are then queued together before being pushed.

```git push``` will then update the repository with all of the previously committed code, including their messages and timestamps, to the GitHub repository linked to the IDE.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages ###
The site was deployed using Github Pages. The live link to the site is: TBA
<br>
A site can be deployed to GitHub Pages by:
- Selecting the 'Settings' in your GitHub repository.
- Selecting the 'Pages' tab from the left-hand menu.
- From the 'source' drop-down selecting 'Branch: Main'.
- Click Save.
- After a few moments, refresh the page and link to the live site will be available at the top of the page.
