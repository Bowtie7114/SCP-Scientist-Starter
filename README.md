# SCP Scientist Orientation #
The SCP Scientist Orientation is an interactive website in which the user takes a mostly-guided tour through an orientation process for a new Level 2 Scientist working at the fictional SCP Foundation. <br>
The purposefully sterile look of the site should belay the overall feel of the Foundation compared to what they do, with descriptions and images of protocols and SCPs, and links in the footnotes to the main source of information for them.<br><br>

The site's intended audience is those who are familiar with the SCP Foundation and enjoy perusing the non-canon content on offer, as well as those not massively familiar with the Foundation, <br>
as a way to stoke curiosity, with many links, images, and references to the main site to allow them to explore further. The live site can be accessed here: [SCP Scientist Orientation](https://bowtie7114.github.io/SCP-Scientist-Starter/index.html).<br><br>

## Features ##
All features moving forwards will be listed. To experience them first hand it is recommended to test the website first, then read this section.<br>
Any links/references are made using superscripted numbers inside square brackets. These are then available to check in the footer with URLs to the pages, opening in separate tabs.<br>
### Login page ###

When first loading the page the Logo, title, and login form will fade in due to a JavaScript function monitoring for the loading of the web content. You then log in using a name and password of your choice.<br>
All three fields must be filled in, and the password fields must match, and the login button will then enable, also controlled by a web listener function. Once logged in, another function activates to save the Username and begin incrementing a number from 0.<br>

![index enabled](docs/readme_images/index_enabled.PNG)<br><br>

### Welcome page ###

Within the welcome page, the Username entered from the login page is entered at the top with a separate function. The User must then interact with the image of MalO by clicking on it to trigger the first event.<br>
This changes the image and caption underneath, and triggers an alert, counting up the earlier number from 0 to 1.<br>

![welcome before](docs/readme_images/welcome_before.PNG)
![welcome after](docs/readme_images/welcome_after.PNG)<br><br>

### SCPs page ###

Once the user moves on, they will need to select a black box at the bottom right of the page, opening a context menu. Once they select the correct option AND they selected MalO previously, they are presented with the alert and increment of their score.<br>
If they are incorrect, then a separate alert will trigger and the score will not increment. In both instances, the menu and box dissapear.<br>

![scps wrong](docs/readme_images/scps_wrong.PNG)
![scps after](docs/readme_images/scps_after.PNG)<br><br>

### Responsibilities page ###

The responsiblities page is bare, but this is because the user must carefully read the paragraphs. So long as they have two points, and find the wrong letter, they can click on it to increment their score and change the letter.<br>

![cafetoria](docs/readme_images/cafetoria.PNG)
![cafeteria](docs/readme_images/cafeteria.PNG)<br><br>

### Containment Breaches page ###

Once all three points up to this point are collected, a Captcha will appear at the end. It is not case sensitive, changed within the function, and the User can make as many mistakes as they like.<br>
Once the captcha is complete, they are immediately redirected to the secret page. If they do not have three points when on this page, it will not appear.<br>

![captcha](docs/readme_images/captcha.PNG)
![no captcha](docs/readme_images/no_captcha.PNG)<br><br>

### Secret page ###

Should the User complete the captcha, they will be directed to this page. Clicking the "Are you alive?" button fades in the information, and once they have read it, they can progress to the last page at their leisure.<br>

![before button](docs/readme_images/before_button.PNG)
![after button](docs/readme_images/after_button.PNG)

### Congratulations Page ###
The downloadable image has been purposefully left as a .png file in case Users wish to actually utilise it. A lot of non-web based applications do not recognise .webp and will either throw an error or change the file type.<br>
Upon selecting download, the User will be presented with the image in a new tab to right-click and save. Otherwise, they can restart the experience from the Login page by selecting the button to do so.<br>

![congrats end](docs/readme_images/congrats_end.PNG)<br><br>

### 404 page ###

Should the User find their way here, they can simply press the button to return to the initial login page.<br>

## Testing (May be in separate .md file depending on size) ##
### Accessibility ###
The [Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used for testing at the end of development. Several key points were the lack of aria-labels, so these were added throughout the website,<br>
especially for interactivity points, to remove the errors on the Accessibility Tool: <br><br>

![index wave tool](docs/readme_images/index_wave.PNG)<br><br>

The pages containing the animated nav menu all have an error that there is empty form label on the page. As this was code that was taken from elsewhere (and referenced) it shall not be altered: <br><br>

![welcome wave tool](docs/readme_images/welcome_wave.PNG)<br><br>

On responsibilities.html there is a contrast error as the entire paragraph has been blacked out. These same errors appear on secret.html and breaches.html for similar reasons. This is intentional and so it will not be changed:<br><br>

![responsiblities wave tool](docs/readme_images/responsibilities_wave.PNG)<br><br>

### Lighthouse ###
Lighthouse testing was performed using Google Chrome and all images were first-time runs after the completion of development. <br><br>

![404 page](docs/readme_images/404_lighthouse.PNG) <br>

### Functional ###

### Validators ###
- HTML
The [W3C HTML Validator]() was used for each separate html page and showed the following:

- index.html passed on the first test after development:<br>
![index Validator](docs/readme_images/index_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- welcome.html did not pass due to a trailing slash on an input and an error that an 'a' element must not be a descendant of a button element.<br>
The code for this was ``` ``` <br>
It has been changed to ```<input type="button" id="next-page-button" onclick="location.href='scps.html';" value="Next page">```<br>.
Upon changing the above, no further errors were identified:<br>
![welcome validator](docs/readme_images/welcome_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- scps.html did not pass due to a p element being the child of a ul element. This was changed to an li and the issue resolved.<br>
![scps validator](docs/readme_images/scps_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- responsibilities.html passed on the first test after development:<br>
![responsibilities validator](docs/readme_images/responsibilities_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- breaches.html did not pass due to an empty img src. This will not be fixed however as it is part of the JavaScript functionality and is filled in once conditions are met, and testing on multiple browsers did not show an issue with overall functionality.<br>
For future fixes, it may be better to upload a placeholder image and render it invisible, then changing the image and rendering it visible again once conditions are met:<br>
![breaches validator](docs/readme_images/breaches_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- secret.html passed on the first test after development:<br>
![secret validator](docs/readme_images/secret_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- congrats.html did not pass due to an a element being a child of a button element. This was the download button rather than next page button like the other examples. After resolving, the no errors were found:<br>
![congrats validator](docs/readme_images/congrats_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- 404.html passed on teh second test, after changing the button to an input from earlier:<br>
![404 validator](docs/readme_images/404_validator.PNG)<br><br>

- CSS
The [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator showed zero errors upon testing at the end of development.<br><br>

![CSS Validator](docs/readme_images/CSS_validator.PNG)<br><br>

-JavaScript
Using [JShint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JavaScript, there were a total of 22 warnings with no errors, three undefined variables, and five unused variables. <br>
Three warnings were the use of 'let' as it is available in ES6, one similar but template literals, and one regarding arrow function syntax, but all were not needing to change.
One regarded a missing semicolon on line 161, which was added. The remaining were the use of unnecessary semi-colons, of which they were removed.<br>
The function correctCaptcha has three variables not assigned correctly, and were assigned with 'var'.<br><br>

Following this, only 5 warnings remained and these will be left to not damage functionality.<br><br>

### Bugs and Fixes ###
- A separate scriptsheet was created specifically for the index page, index.js, to house the animation javascript code. It would run on other pages continuously as it was looking for elements that did not exist on those pages due to the eventhandler 
allocated to it. Future attempts will work towards making it so that the separate page was not necessary.
- Following on from the above - code was added on lines 1-5 of script.js that allows the page target from the URL to be shortened to just the html names (eg. index.html, welcome.html etc). I could then use if statements so that certain functions only worked on certain pages, preventing continuous loading where it was not needed.

- When opening the python3 server the day after creating the fade animation, it ceased to work. This was because the if statement was checking for index.html, which did not appear on the end of the page URL when first loading, it appeared as an empty string. By adding the empty string as an or ( || ) to the if statement, it began to function as normal.

- Upon changing ```buttons``` to ```inputs``` to allow for the use of href, the function that changed the Next Page link on breaches.html was broken and no longer changed it to point towards secret.html.<br>
Upon changing the function from link.href to location.href, it instead immediately redirects to secret.html upon completion of the Captcha. As I found this behaviour preferable, I kept it and changed the alert to 'Redirecting...'<br><br>

## Deployment ##
### Version Control ###

This website was made using Gitpod as the IDE which was linked to GitHub, allowing it to be saved as a remote repository named "SCP-Scientist-Starter" using git commands.

Said commands used to push to the repository are:

```git add <file>``` which adds the file (or all changes if you use . ) to the staging area to be committed.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` then commits the changes that were added previously, along with a message indicating what was changed. These commits are then queued together before being pushed.

```git push``` will then update the repository with all of the previously committed code, including their messages and timestamps, to the GitHub repository linked to the IDE.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages ###
The site was deployed using Github Pages. The live link to the site is: TBA
<br>
A site can be deployed to GitHub Pages by:
- Selecting the 'Settings' in your GitHub repository.
- Selecting the 'Pages' tab from the left-hand menu.
- From the 'source' drop-down selecting 'Branch: Main'.
- Click Save.
- After a few moments, refresh the page and link to the live site will be available at the top of the page.
