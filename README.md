## Technologies ##
- HTML
  <br> Used as the structure language for the site.
- CSS
  <br> Used to style the website via an external stylesheet.
- JavaScript
  <br> Used to introduce interactivity to the site via an external scriptsheet.
- GitHub
  <br> Used as a repository to store site information and act as a hosting platform.
- Git
  <br> Used to commit and push information to GitHub.
- Gitpod
  <br> Used as the IDE for this sites development.
- FontAwesome
  <br> Used to display symbols.
- balsamiq
  <br> Used to create wireframe designs for website.
- cloudconvert.com
  <br> Used to convert images to .webp format.
- tinypng.com
  <br> Used to compress image files before upload to increase web loading performance.

## Testing (May be in separate .md file depending on size) ##
### Accessibility ###

### Lighthouse ###

### Functional ###

### Bugs and Fixes ###
- A separate scriptsheet was created specifically for the index page, index.js, to house the animation javascript code. It would run on other pages continuously as it was looking for elements that did not exist on those pages due to the eventhandler 
allocated to it. Future attempts will work towards making it so that the separate page was not necessary.
- Following on from the above - code was added on lines 1-5 of script.js that allows the page target from the URL to be shortened to just the html names (eg. index.html, welcome.html etc). I could then use if statements so that certain functions only worked on certain pages, preventing continuous loading where it was not needed.

## Deployment ##
### Version Control ###

This website was made using Gitpod as the IDE which was linked to GitHub, allowing it to be saved as a remote repository named "SCP-Scientist-Starter" using git commands.

Said commands used to push to the repository are:

```git add <file>``` which adds the file (or all changes if you use . ) to the staging area to be committed.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` then commits the changes that were added previously, along with a message indicating what was changed. These commits are then queued together before being pushed.

```git push``` will then update the repository with all of the previously committed code, including their messages and timestamps, to the GitHub repository linked to the IDE.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages ###
The site was deployed using Github Pages. The live link to the site is: TBA
<br>
A site can be deployed to GitHub Pages by:
- Selecting the 'Settings' in your GitHub repository.
- Selecting the 'Pages' tab from the left-hand menu.
- From the 'source' drop-down selecting 'Branch: Main'.
- Click Save.
- After a few moments, refresh the page and link to the live site will be available at the top of the page.
